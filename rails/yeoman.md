Yeoman Rails Hack
=

Overview
-

The idea behind this is that its easier to modularize front-end code as a seperate asset with yeoman than building on top of the rails asset pipeline.
Can use bower instead of gem dependencies and then we can have modularized front-end repos like this etc...

This is responsible for running all assets through node so that all assets can be updated in realtime by using node vs ruby for asset compilation
