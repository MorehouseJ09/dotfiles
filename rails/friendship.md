Rails Application Friendship System
=

What I'm trying to do:
-

I want to create a simple system where users share a friendship document.
Friendships should work similar to any other social network
The friendship logistics (adding, accepting, pending ... ) should all be handled with a gem (amico) whereas the friendship should be handled by a custom document
