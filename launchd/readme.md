Mac Launch Agents / LaunchD
=

This directory is useful for storing the launch agents I'm currently using on my mac machine.
Launchagents and cronjobs using launchd can be placed here
I'm assuming that the files that are running this are user-local and should thus be installed to the ~/Library/LaunchAgents directory
